A practice in java logic. Subject matter is in security.

This is a console program that takes in information and translates it into something else. The idea started from basic cypher 
logic:

this was the inspiration point to this. I also stumbled on some youtube videos with binary info flashing in them and thought
it would be fun to decode this and make it into a console output program. I have not done these types of programs for awhile 
and this was a good practice for that area. It is all about React, Javascript, Node or Redux for me at the moment so this 
was a fun program to do in Java again :)
